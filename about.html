                <p>Prior to my move to London, I was working part-time in the hospitality industry as a waiter. In this role, I have worked 
                    at Plymouth Argyle Football Club, Celtic Manor, International Convention Centre and the Six Nations Rugby Tournament in 2022.
                    My first job also involved waiting and it was at a restaurant that my dad used to own. Aside from these roles, I have also worked 
                    part time at food production factories such as Ginsters in Cornwall and Two Sisters in Newport.
